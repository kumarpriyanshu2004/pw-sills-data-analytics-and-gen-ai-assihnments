        "1. Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Model: SQL uses structured tables with predefined schemas; NoSQL stores data in flexible formats (document, key-value, graph, columnar).\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: SQL is usually vertically scalable; NoSQL supports horizontal scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Schema: SQL requires fixed schema; NoSQL is schema-less or schema-flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transactions: SQL follows strict ACID compliance; NoSQL often prioritizes availability and scalability (BASE model), though modern NoSQL (like MongoDB) supports ACID transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Query Language: SQL uses SQL syntax; NoSQL uses database-specific query APIs (e.g., MongoDB Query Language - MQL).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why MongoDB Is a Good Choice for Modern Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexible schema for evolving data structures.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Concept of Collections in MongoDB\n",
        "\n",
        "A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collections do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing documents to have varying fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "They store BSON (binary JSON) documents for efficient storage and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. High Availability in MongoDB via Replication\n",
        "\n",
        "Achieved through Replica Sets — multiple copies of data across servers.\n",
        "\n",
        "One primary node handles writes, multiple secondary nodes replicate data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic failover: if the primary fails, a secondary is promoted to primary.\n",

        "\n",
        "Purpose: Speed up data retrieval by avoiding full collection scans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexes store small, ordered subsets of data fields for faster searches.\n",

        "\n",
        "Replication: Copying data across multiple servers for high availability.\n",
        "\n",

        "Consistency: Transactions leave the database in a valid state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Isolation: Transactions are isolated from others until committed.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Storing related data inside a single document instead of separate collections.\n",
        "\n",
